This Laravel package adds multi-theme support to your application. It also provides a simple authentication scaffolding for a starting point for building a Laravel application. And it also has preset for  `Bootstrap`, `Tailwind`, `Vue`, and `React`. So, I believe it is a good alternative to the `laravel/ui` & `laravel/breeze` package.

## Features
- Views & Asset stored in separate the themes folder for easy theme management.
- Theme hierarchy (WordPress style!): It allows creating a child theme to extend any theme.
- Provides a simple authentication scaffolding.
- Provides presets for `bootstrap`, `tailwind`, `vue`, and `react`
