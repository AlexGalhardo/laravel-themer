This Laravel package adds multi-theme support to your application. It also provides a simple authentication scaffolding for a starting point for building a Laravel application. And it also has preset for  `Bootstrap`, `Tailwind`, `Vue`, and `React`. So, I believe it is a good alternative to the `laravel/ui` & `laravel/breeze` package.

## Features
- Any number of themes
- Fallback theme support; It allows creating a child theme to extend any theme
- Provides a simple authentication scaffolding similar to laravel/ui & laravel/breeze package
- Provides frontend presets for bootstrap, tailwind, vue, and react

## Documentation
